# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

	1. Overview: 
	
	We are developing a recipe web app that will suggest recipes to users based on ingredients they indicate they have available on hand. Users who have a difficult time visualizing a meal or doing meal planning will be able to shift focus instead to selecting from a list of possible recipes, reducing some of the stress that can be associated with starting a meal. 
	The idea came from a personal desire for this functionality to try to make meal planning less tedious and daunting.
	
	2. Features:
	
	The features for the MVP at this time are:
		○ Add: Users will be able to add a recipe to the database
		○ Search: Users will be able to search recipes based on multiple ingredients and search terms
		○ List: Users will be able to see a list of all recipes to browse for inspiration
		
	3. Technologies: 
		○ Java
		○ Spring Boot
		○ MySQL
		○ Hibernate
		○ Thymeleaf templates
		
	4. What you’ll have to learn: 
 
	Data storage structure of the database and user experience questions are still to be determined for the project
